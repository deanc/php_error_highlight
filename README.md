Pipe through this script when tailing or viewing php error logs to make them a little prettier. For now it just makes the timestamp red.

Installation:

Create a "bin" directory under your home directory:
	mkdir ~/bin

Then copy hl.sh into this directory.

Usage:

	tail -f /var/log/php/error_log | hl.sh
